# JetSoundsUpdated
JetSounds is a sound replacement patch, updated for the latest version of RealPlume

Jet Sounds Continued

Jet Sounds was an amazing mod that eventually stop being updated. After this happened many people wanted 
the creator to keep developing it, or for someone to release their own copy that worked.

It was picked up and maintained for a while by @Patrick_the_big, but it hasn't been updated since KSP 1.4.5 was out.

RealPlume was recently updated and broke the RAPIER patch.  I've fixed that and added in the little patch to fix
 RealPlume and the mod.

I've also renamed to mod to JetSoundsUpdated
